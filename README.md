AngularJS base component library to build large scale web applications with component architecture in mind.

The `src` folder contains an example component, in this case a simple button. The `test` folder contains tests written for this button. Feel free to create an alternative structure for your components.

The `dist` folder contains the distributable components and produces a JS and CSS file. Link these files to any project to use a component.

The only dependency is AngularJS.
